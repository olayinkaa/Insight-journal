## Binary Tree
- A tree where every node has atmost two children 
- exactly one root node
- exactly 1 path between root and any node

## Empty tree
Tree with zero node

## Leaf node
- has no children

## Depth-first traversal
- use stack data structure
- Time complexity is 0(n)
- space complexity is 0(n)

## Breadth-first traversal (BFT)
- use queue data structure
- Time complexity is 0(n)
- space complexity is 0(n)
