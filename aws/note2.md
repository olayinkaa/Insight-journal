# AWS Availability Zone
+ Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example
  - ap-southeast-2a
  - ap-southeast-2b
  - ap-southeast-2c
+ Each availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity
+ They are separated from each other, so that they are isolated from disasters
+ They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
