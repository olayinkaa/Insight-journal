```md
<!-- event modifier -->
v-on:click.prevent
v-on:click.right
v-on:input

- The shorthand for 'v-on' is simply '@'
- The shorthand for 'v-bind' is ':'
- Any non-event bind method should be a computed method
- method is not the best solution for outputting dynamic calculated value, instead use computed
