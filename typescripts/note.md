# Annotations

- Annotations are used to specify the data types of a variable, parameter, function return value and other types of values. Help developers catch errors early in development by allowing them to specify what types of values can be assigned to a given variable or passed as an argument to a function.
  
# Type Inference
Type inference is a feature in typescript that allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its value. In other words, if you declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type, typescript will try to infer the type based on the value you assign to it

# Any type
When a variable is annotated with any type, typescript will allow it to have any value and disable all type checking for that variable and its properties.
