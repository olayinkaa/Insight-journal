# Docker workflow
- docker client: user interface for interacting with docker, the tools we use to give docker command.
  
- docker host or docker daemon: is the background process responsible for managing container on the host system, listen for docker client command, create and manage container, build images
  
- docker registry or docker hub: centralized repository of docker images,holds both public and private packages. Centralize storage for storing our images.

# What is a container
- A docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application

- A way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

# Containers
- layers of images mostly linux base image because of small in size
- containers are ephemeral: by default, no persistence
- All data is gone when containers are removed

# Open Container initiative (OCI)
Is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.
- Runtime specification
- Image specification
- Distribution specification

# Container Engine
is what unpacks the container files and hands them off to the operating system kernel

# Namespaces
A namespace wraps a global system resources in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.

Changes to the global resource are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace but are invisible to other processes

# Cgroups
A linux kernel feature which allow processes to be organiszed into hierarchical groups whose usage of various types of resources can then be limited and monitored.

# Understanding Data within containers
- by default all data created or modified in containers is ephemeral
- if some data should be present every time a container image is run (e.g dependency), it should be built into the image itself.
- If data is generated by the application that needs to be persisted, a volume should be used to store that outside of the ephemeral container filesystem

# Private Docker Registry
- Amazon ECR
- Digital Ocean
  
# Docker volume
- Host volume: you decide where on the host file system the reference is made
- Anonymous volume (Automatically created by docker): For each container a folder is generated that gets mounted
- Named volumes : you can reference the volume by name, should be used in production

# Docker volume location
- C:\programData\docker\volumes `window`
- /var/lib/docker/volumes `mac`
- /var/lib/docker/volumes `linux`

# Dockerfile
- is a set of instructions telling docker how to build an image for our application
- dockerfile commands: FROM, WORKDIR, RUN, CMD, EXPOSE, COPY, ENV, ARG, VOLUME, ENTRYPOINT
- CMD more flexible and can be overriden
- ENTRYPOINT cannot be overriden

# docker init
# docker compose watch
-  sync, rebuild, sync-restart
