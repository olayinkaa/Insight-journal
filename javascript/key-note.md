### Important key functions, methods , topics
- event loop and event queue
- Algorithm and Data structure
- Appy, bind, call
- ***from, fromEntries***
- splice, slice
- map, reduce, filter, forEach
- every, some, include
- substring, substr, join, split
- findIndex, concat, flat
- ***Map and Set***
- ***fromCharCode***
- ***charCodeAt***
- ***fill***

- Space complexity amount of memory an algorithm use to run
- why is time complexity priotized over space complexity ? 
because costs to product and run processors are much higher compared to RAM

- Boolean, num, undefined, null are always constant space complexity
- String, array, object have dynamic space complexity
- ASCII
- ellipsis character


## String methods
- startsWith => true or false
- endsWith => true or false
- indexOf => return index number
- lastIndexOf => return the last index position of the string
- trim => remove leading and trailing whitespace
- concat => Join two strings
- charAt => return the index position
- substring(startIndex, endIndex) endIndex not inclusive.
