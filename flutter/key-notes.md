## Key Note
- Dart does not support multiple inheritance
- `super` keyword is available in `extends`
- you cannot extends and implements the same class
-  concept in object oriented programming: 
  * Polymorphism
  * Abstraction
  * Inheritance
  * Encapsulation
- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms
- Encapsulation protect our data from outside world manipulation
- Mixin is good for code reuse
- `Object` is the baseClass of `String`, `integer` etc except `null`
- whenever you create a class, it also created `toString()` method
